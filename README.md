# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test code, but you
can base yours on test code from other exercises.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not? Add your answer, including your
reasoning, to this markdown file.

## My Response
Yes, the tail recursive version of the fibonacci sequence has a different complexity.  The tail recursive version should have a complexity of $\Theta(n)$ due to the fact that each recursive call is only instance at a time, so there aren't any other recursive calls floating around waiting for the calculations to finish, it just runs each call individually
